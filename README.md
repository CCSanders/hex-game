# hex-game

This is my repo for my Hex Grid Strategy game, heavily inspired by the Civilization series. This game is a WIP and on hiatus until I am not simultaneously going to school and working remote as a developer. I made super great progress on this (this is about a month's worth of development) and I learned a ton. 

Here's a cool pic of the city screen:
